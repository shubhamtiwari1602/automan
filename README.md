# Assembly Line Simulation

An interactive assembly line simulation project created by Group 11:
- Shubham Tiwari
- Soham Zade
- Niket Aggarwal

## Features

- Visualizes a complex assembly line with multiple components
- Interactive controls for adjusting conveyor speeds
- Real-time metrics calculation for production efficiency
- Animated simulation of the assembly process

## How to Use

1. Open the [GitHub Pages site](https://shubhamtiwari1602.github.io/assembly-simulation/)
2. Adjust the conveyor speeds using the sliders
3. Click "Run Simulation" to see the assembly process and view metrics
4. Observe how different speed settings affect production efficiency

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- D3.js for visualizations
